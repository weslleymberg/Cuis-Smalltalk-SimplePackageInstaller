# Cuis-Smalltalk-SimplePackageInstaller
A little package to install new packages from the world menu.

It has only 2 class side methods: #installPackage asks for package name to install; and #worldMenuOptions to make it appear in the world menu.

Note: there is an official alternative to this package in https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/Cuis-Smalltalk-Tools/blob/main/Goodies/FeatureRequirer.pck.st
